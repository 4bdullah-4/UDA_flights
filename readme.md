# Flights Data Exploration
## by Abdullah Al Ajjan

## Dataset

The dataset is a combination of two datasets one that contains all the flights in April 2019 and the other is of April 2020. This combination resulted in more than 260,000 flights that encountered an issue like a delay in flight, cancellation or a divertion.


## Summary of Findings

As a summary, the number of flights went down to almost half from 2019 to 2020.With that being said the number of cancelled flights in 2020 is much more than that in 2019, which is due to the spread of Covid 19. Moreover, the number of cancelled flights went down from the begining to the end of the month of April.
In general, flight delays are usually less than an hour, yet there are many times where a delay could take up to 3 hours or more. The reasons behind a flight being delayed are many yet the a flight arrival time is mostly affected by late aurcraft delay followed by carrier delay, NAS delay, weather delay and finally security delay. Even though flight delay time went down from 2019 to 2020, probably because the number of flights are much less in 2020 yet, Carrer delay and security delay became higher in 2020 this is probably because the precautions and safety measures taken due to the pandemic. Taking a further look into the reasons for the a flight to be delayed I studied the correlation between the date and time of the flight and the delay. I noticed that the correlation between them is very little thus the time and date of the flight doesn't affect the flight being on time or not.
Besides delaying and cancellation, many flights also divert away from their destination this might be for various reason one of which the difficulty in landing due to weather or conditions or other reason. The destination that get mostly diverted away from are Dallas, Chicago, Charlotte, Atlanta, Denver, Pheonix, Las Vegas, Queens, Los Angeles, and Houston.
We can say that the departure delay is equal to the arrival delay most of the times, though there are sometimes where the delay occur during the flight, the take, or the landing. Many times the delaying is caused by the carrier. The carriers responsible for the most time delays are JetBlue and Endeavor Air followed  by Express jet. 
Finally, taking a look at where the flights that encountered an issue originated, I noticed that the flights with most delay time come from North Dakota, Mississippi, Kansas, Vermont, and West Virginia. This delay could be caused by the weather conditions in the state as it is for North Dakota, Mississippi, and Vermont.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The key insights for the presentation are shown by the graphs that show the number of cancelled flights distributed over April 2019 and 2020, the Number of occurance of each delay time, the number of times a flight diverts from a destination, the delay times for carriers, the relation between date and time and the delay time, and finally the delay time of each carrier and the reasons for every delay between the year 2019 and 2020.
